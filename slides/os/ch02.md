## 哲学家进餐问题
Five philosophers, numbered from 0 through 4 are living in a house where the table laid for them, each philosopher having his own place at the table. Their only problem - besides those of philosophy - is that the dish served is a very difficult kind of spaghetti, that has to be eaten with two forks. There are two forks next to each plate, so that presents no difficulty: as a consequence, however, no two neighbours may be eating simultaneously.

## 读者写者问题
一个数据文件或记录，可被多个进程共享，我们把只要求读该文件的进程称为“Reader进程”，其他进程则称为“Writer 进程”允许多个进程同时读一个共享对象，因为读操作不会使数据文件混乱。但不允许一个 Writer 进程和其他 Reader 进程或Writer 进程同时访问共享对象，因为这种访问将会引起混乱。

## [The Little Book of Semaphores](https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/)
> When I took the Operating Systems class at Berkeley, and taught it at Colby
College, I got the impression that most students were able to understand the
solutions to these problems, but few would have been able to produce them, or
solve similar problems.
